This project is designed to allow me to push a button connected to an arduino and have something happen on my computer.  I'm not terribly interested in what happens right now, but something ought to.

At present, it works!  On Windows only, but that's something.  Currently in development is a Linux version.  The arduino code is simplicity itself; wait for a button-press then send "input received" over a 9600-baud serial connection.  The Windows code is also fairly easy; wait for "input received" over a 9600-baud serial connection, then run the do_stuff() method.

The current sample do_stuff() method pops up a messagebox.

Improvements to be made:
	Windows threading; listen while do_stuff() is running.
	Linux support:  figure out serial connections
	Makefiles:  make it less hideous to recompile this.
	More interesting do_stuff() methods:  later.
